        <h3>NASA observed for the fifth time that a black hole ate a wandering star</h3>
        <p>
            Black holes are one of the most curious phenomena in our universe. From pictures of black holes in our<br>
            Milky Way Galaxy to trying to understand how they formed, and even what would happen when two black<br> 
            holes merged, scientists have pushed our understanding of these celestial entities to an unprecedented<br>
            height. But now, NASA has actually seen a black hole eat a star.<br>

            In order to get a good view of this event, NASA uses several space telescopes to observe the process of<br>
             black holes devouring stars. This hapless star is too close to the black hole, which is about 250 mill<br>
             ion light years away from the Earth. According to NASA, this is the fifth closest example of a black h<br>
             ole devouring a star that we have observed.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            To unravel how these deaths occurred, NASA shared an embedded video showing how a star begins to crack<br> 
            and flatten as it approaches a black hole. Then, as it gets closer, the star is actually torn apart an<br>
            d sucked into the black hole itself. This process is officially called tidal destruction event.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, NASA hopes to learn more about these events through in-depth excavation. By learning more about wh<br>
            at happens when a black hole engulfs a star, we can learn more about the interaction of black holes when<br>
             other celestial bodies are too close, which should produce some more intriguing results in the long run.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, because NASA has so many telescopes focusing on this particular event, there is enough data<br>
             for astronomers to use in more in-depth research. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that a team has b<br>
             een established to study these tidal destruction events, and we hope that we will see more information<br>
              in the coming months and years.<br>
